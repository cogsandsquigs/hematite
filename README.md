# Hematite

A Battlesnake written in Rust.

## TODO:

-   [ ] Prefer larger areas over smaller areas when considering two different trapped spaces.
-   [ ] Implement some kind of (effective) searching algorithm to find the next best move
    -   [ ] Use MCTS from a different crate? (instead of my own)?
    -   [ ] Use a different algorithm?
